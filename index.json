According to the statistics, 94% of all Google web traffic is encrypted as of July 2019. In 2019 alone, the encryption certificates issued per day is over 1 million. While protecting the privacy and providing security for enterprises, encryption technology also benefits evaders to secure their malicious activities.\nTraditional solutions to identify network threats fall into two major categories: 1) deep packet inspection and signatures; and 2) offline network pattern modeling. However, the first category is not applicable on encrypted traffic. Furthermore, solutions that work on decrypted network data will compromise the user privacy and data integrity, and are computationally intensive. By passively monitoring malicious behaviors on a session-based level, the second category of traditional solutions demonstrate high accuracy and low false positives. However, training machine learning models, and inferencing with effective models in a timely fashion are challenging due to the high computational power and low response latency requirements.\nWith the recent adoption of network function virtualization (NFV) technology, enterprises start to deploy universal customer premises equipment (uCPE) on their network edge to perform complex network functionality including encrypted traffic analytics (ETA). Such uCPE equipments rely on commodity x86 platforms to enable virtual network functions provisioned without pre-configuration or manual operations. Meanwhile, recent innovation on x86 multicore systems, such as the Intel Data Analytics Acceleration Library (DAAL) for machine learning and the Intel OpenVINO toolkit for computer vision and neural networks, have enabled ETA to render faster training and inference and analyze larger data sets with available compute resources on x86 uCPE equipments. The library also exploits the next-generation processors such as Intel Xeon D to render optimal performance. By exploiting DAAL and OpenVINO, we can greatly accelerate the ETA speed without compromising performance.\nIn this project, we propose to leverage Intel x86 multicore platforms with the aforementioned software to design an ETA system named ACETA with accelerated model training and inference. Specifically, we contribute in the three following aspects. 1) We seek to study the Ciscoâ€™s open-sourced ETA software named Joy as the reference design, and extend Joy with three new machine learning models and test them with a new open-source dataset. 2) We optimize the ETA pipeline in the proposed software package ACETA with multithreading and Intel software packages to render faster training and inference speed without sacrificing performance. 3) We conduct thorough performance evaluation and comparison between Joy and ACETA for future reference.\n","date":1583294115,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583294115,"objectID":"63fcac0541975c3deec4e14205c7aab2","permalink":"https://bluejayadal.github.io/project/aceta/","publishdate":"2020-03-03T22:55:15-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/aceta/","section":"project","summary":"Classify encrypted network traffic with accelerated machine learning models.","tags":["Machine Learning","ETA"],"title":"ACETA: Encrypted Network Traffic Analytics","type":"project"},{"authors":["Derek Manning","Peilong Li","Xiaoban Wu","Yan Luo","Tong Zhang","Weigang Li"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1583293693,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583293693,"objectID":"b3212c03c8815f18b5794b0b18741ad2","permalink":"https://bluejayadal.github.io/publication/2020-icc-aceta/","publishdate":"2020-03-03T22:48:13-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-icc-aceta/","section":"publication","summary":"Applying machine learning techniques to detect malicious encrypted network traffic has become a challenging research topic. Traditional approaches based on studying network patterns fail to operate on encrypted data, especially without compromising the integrity of encryption. In addition, the requirement of rendering network-wide intelligent protection in a timely manner further exacerbates the problem. In this paper, we propose to leverage x86 multicore platforms provisioned at enterprises' network edge with the software accelerators to design an encrypted traffic analytics (ETA) system with accelerated speed. Specifically, we explore a suite of data features and machine learning models with an open dataset. Then we show that by using Intel DAAL and OpenVINO libraries in model training and inference, we are able to reduce the training and inference time by a maximum order of 31x and 46x respectively while retaining the model accuracy.","tags":[],"title":"ACETA: Accelerating Encrypted Traffic Analytics on Network Edge","type":"publication"},{"authors":["ADAL"],"categories":[],"content":"We are always interested in recruiting talented students to join our research group. We also welcome inter-department and industry collaboration.\nSignature Learning Experience Undergraduate students can pursue research experiences in ADAL as an Signature Learning Experience (i.e. senior project) that can be counted towards your graduation credits.
