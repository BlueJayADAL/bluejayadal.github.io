However, it remains an open problem as there are many challenges in training datasets, feature engineering, machine learning models: (1) the datasets used in prior works are heterogeneous in size, traffic types, encryption schemes, which make it difficult to generalize the findings from these research works; (2) it is still a debate whether to infer using network flow features or raw packet bytes as input, both of which have demonstrated a degree of effectiveness; (3) it is interesting to explore the design space of machine learning models, from traditional machine learning approaches to more recent deep neural networks. We aim to investigate whether the models have different effectiveness for different objectives (e.g. traffic classification vs malware detection).\nProject 2: Building a Secure Inter-institutional Data Sharing Platform with Blockchain\nPrincipal Investigator, Faculty Mentor: Dr. Jingwen Wang\nStudent Researchers: Grace Cuff, Jeffry Edmonds\nGrant Amount: $9,440\nProject Duration: 8 Weeks\nAbstract Existing cyberinfrastrucure for inter-institutional data sharing faces challenges. Firstly, traditional infrastructure is a closed environment in a single or multiple fixed location, and cannot be used efficiently to share data securely among multiple institutions. For example, the patient data collected at a medical school cannot be readily shared with data scientist collaborators from a nearby institution. IRB approval, verifiable encryption and secure storage are only a few of the many prerequisites. Secondly, even though cloud services can provide a unified resource for institutional collaboration, the latency, bandwidth and cost of cloud-based computing do not scale well with emerging needs. Real-world cloud has its latency in the order of hundreds of milliseconds and its bandwidth is significantly limited by the shared network pipe. The cost incurred through compute time and storage can easily exceed research budget. Thirdly, there is no available open-sourced online portals that provide a clean interface for requesting and authenticating data to be used inter-institutionally.\n","date":1583933535,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583933535,"objectID":"cc67ce1f27c40bbb58fdd70f91d3e78d","permalink":"https://bluejayadal.github.io/post/2020-scarp-grant/","publishdate":"2020-03-11T09:32:15-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/2020-scarp-grant/","section":"post","summary":"Our research group ADAL receives two summer research grants from Etown College.","tags":["Grant","SCARP"],"title":"ADAL receives two 2020 SCARP Grants","type":"post"},{"authors":["ADAL"],"categories":["Conference"],"content":"Program Committee Member Dr. Li was honored to be one of the three organizing committee co-chairs for the upcoming 1st Workshop on Network Traffic Analytics using Machine Learning (NetAML), co-located with IJCAI 2020 in Yokohama, Japan.\nAs a PC Co-Chair, Dr. Li will be helping find paper reviewers, review the paper submissions, judge the competition, and manage the workshop website.\nNETAML Workshop The NETAML 2020 workshop aims to provide a venue for the community to present and discuss the latest advances in traffic analysis, with an emphasis on novel machine learning based approaches.

According to the statistics, 94% of all Google web traffic is encrypted as of July 2019. In 2019 alone, the encryption certificates issued per day is over 1 million. While protecting the privacy and providing security for enterprises, encryption technology also benefits evaders to secure their malicious activities.\nTraditional solutions to identify network threats fall into two major categories: 1) deep packet inspection and signatures; and 2) offline network pattern modeling. However, the first category is not applicable on encrypted traffic. Furthermore, solutions that work on decrypted network data will compromise the user privacy and data integrity, and are computationally intensive. By passively monitoring malicious behaviors on a session-based level, the second category of traditional solutions demonstrate high accuracy and low false positives. However, training machine learning models, and inferencing with effective models in a timely fashion are challenging due to the high computational power and low response latency requirements.\nWith the recent adoption of network function virtualization (NFV) technology, enterprises start to deploy universal customer premises equipment (uCPE) on their network edge to perform complex network functionality including encrypted traffic analytics (ETA). Such uCPE equipments rely on commodity x86 platforms to enable virtual network functions provisioned without pre-configuration or manual operations. Meanwhile, recent innovation on x86 multicore systems, such as the Intel Data Analytics Acceleration Library (DAAL) for machine learning and the Intel OpenVINO toolkit for computer vision and neural networks, have enabled ETA to render faster training and inference and analyze larger data sets with available compute resources on x86 uCPE equipments. The library also exploits the next-generation processors such as Intel Xeon D to render optimal performance. By exploiting DAAL and OpenVINO, we can greatly accelerate the ETA speed without compromising performance.\nIn this project, we propose to leverage Intel x86 multicore platforms with the aforementioned software to design an ETA system named ACETA with accelerated model training and inference. Specifically, we contribute in the three following aspects. 1) We seek to study the Cisco’s open-sourced ETA software named Joy as the reference design, and extend Joy with three new machine learning models and test them with a new open-source dataset. 2) We optimize the ETA pipeline in the proposed software package ACETA with multithreading and Intel software packages to render faster training and inference speed without sacrificing performance. 3) We conduct thorough performance evaluation and comparison between Joy and ACETA for future reference.\n","date":1583294115,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583294115,"objectID":"63fcac0541975c3deec4e14205c7aab2","permalink":"https://bluejayadal.github.io/project/aceta/","publishdate":"2020-03-03T22:55:15-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/aceta/","section":"project","summary":"Classify encrypted network traffic with accelerated machine learning models.","tags":["Machine Learning","ETA"],"title":"ACETA: Encrypted Network Traffic Analytics","type":"project"},{"authors":["Derek Manning","Peilong Li","Xiaoban Wu","Yan Luo","Tong Zhang","Weigang Li"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1583293693,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583293693,"objectID":"b3212c03c8815f18b5794b0b18741ad2","permalink":"https://bluejayadal.github.io/publication/2020-icc-aceta/","publishdate":"2020-03-03T22:48:13-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-icc-aceta/","section":"publication","summary":"Applying machine learning techniques to detect malicious encrypted network traffic has become a challenging research topic. Traditional approaches based on studying network patterns fail to operate on encrypted data, especially without compromising the integrity of encryption.

In this paper, we propose to leverage x86 multicore platforms provisioned at enterprises' network edge with the software accelerators to design an encrypted traffic analytics (ETA) system with accelerated speed. Specifically, we explore a suite of data features and machine learning models with an open dataset. Then we show that by using Intel DAAL and OpenVINO libraries in model training and inference, we are able to reduce the training and inference time by a maximum order of 31x and 46x respectively while retaining the model accuracy.","tags":[],"title":"ACETA: Accelerating Encrypted Traffic Analytics on Network Edge","type":"publication"},{"authors":["ADAL"],"categories":[],"content":"We are always interested in recruiting talented students to join our research group.
